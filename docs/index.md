2. Click the '**Don't have an account? Sign up!**' link, located at the bottom of the pop-up:  
<img src="img/signup-link.png" alt="An image highlighting the sign-up link" width="650"/>

3. Enter a username, password, email address, and date of birth.  
  (Be sure to choose a strong password which meets our security requirements!)
4. Click on the '**Register**' button.
