# Introduction

Hello and welcome to PixelVault! PixelVault is a web-based Pixel art editor and gallery, which  allows users to create, share and sell [pixel art](#what-is-pixel-art). 

This user manual serves to provide a detailed overview of PixelVault, its functionalities and step-by-step instructions to help you navigate and use the system.

**This document is intended for:**
- Beginners who want to start creating pixel art or are familiarising themselves with the system's features.
- Artists who wish to share their pixel art.
- Individuals looking to join a community of like-minded people.

We have developed PixelVault to make the process of creating and distributing pixel art as easy as possible. As well as to provide artists with the tools necessary to list and license their artwork with ease.

The system is comprised of **two** key components:

-  **Collaborative Editor:** A real-time collaborative canvas, allowing multiple users to edit the same project simultaneously.
- **Sharing Platform:** 
    - A website through which artists can publish their artwork and share it with other users, according to a licence of their choosing.
    - All users can then engage with the community, for instance by following other artists, or liking and/or commenting on posts.

# Overview

Here we take a look at the features of PixelVault.

## Features of the system

- **Pixel art editor:**
    - **Tools:** Users can edit the canvas using a 'pencil' tool (with a variable brush-stroke size).
	- **Collaboration:** Users can invite other artists to collaborate on a project; changes made by collaborators are reflected in real-time.
	- **Export:** Artwork can be easily exported as PNG files.
- **Gallery:**
    - **Search and Filter:** Search published works by attributes such as title, author, and tags.
    - **Sorting:** Artwork can be sorted by likes, recency of publication, or title.
    - **Licencing:** Artists can select a licence when publishing their artwork giving them control over
                     how their work may be used.
- **Community:**
    - **Account Registration:** Users can sign up with an email, username, and password, allowing them to log in and engage with the platform.
    - **Reporting System:** Users have the power to report any malicious or offensive content, triggering a review process by the admin team, ensuring that the community remains safe and respectful!
    - **Administrative Oversight:** Admins also have the authority to remove any such malicious or offensive content.
    - **Social Engagement:** Users can follow their favourite artists to track their work and view their new posts.
    - **Content Promotion:** The visibility of posts is influenced by the number of likes, the more likes a post receives, the higher it will appear on the explore page!

  or you can directly input a specific RGBA/Hex value.

<img src="img/undo.png" alt="undo tool" width="50"/>

*Note*: The history for the Undo and Redo actions is not retained once the editor is closed or the page is refreshed.

## Working Offline

You do not need to take any extra steps to work 'offline', when you first open a
blank canvas, this will be offline. This means that your work will not be saved,
so be careful not to lose your work by refreshing the page.

Note that you can switch to an 'online' canvas at any point by [saving the project](#saving-a-project),
though this will require you to have an account and be logged in.

## Save/Load Project
